# Springboard.com: Data Science Career Track
## Capstone Project 1

### Data Wrangling
All of my data wrangling efforts are documented in the respective Jupyter Notebooks found in the  **Datasets** folder:
1. us_sugarcane_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_sugarcane.csv
2. fl_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_fl_weather.csv
3. la_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_fl_weather.csv

Feel free to comment on different analysis techniques as this project is more focused on learning the basics of Data Science.
